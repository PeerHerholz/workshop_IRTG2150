# Basics in data handling

[Nibabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/) and [Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/index.html) are two `python packages` that help to `load`, `modify`, `save` and `visualize neuroimaging data`.
The two software packages together allow you to do almost anything with your `MRI data` that you want. In order to provide a quick introduction and overview of their functionality and capabilities we prepared two short notebooks that will showcase that. 

Additionally, we will have a look at how we can query and extract information from [BIDS](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) `datasets` using the [pybids](https://bids-standard.github.io/pybids/index.html) package.

You can find all sections in the `ToC` on the left.

## Nibabel

`Nibabel`'s main focus is on `loading` and `saving` any kind of `neuroimaging data`.

## Nilearn

`Nilearn`'s main focus is on `statistical learning` (based on [scikit-learn]()) but is also very good in `manipulation` and `visualizing neuroimaging data`.

## Pybids

`Pybids` is a `python package` that allows you to `query` and `extract` information from `BIDS datasets`.
